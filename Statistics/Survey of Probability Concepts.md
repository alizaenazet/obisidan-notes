## Decide and understand the classification of a probability
To decide and understand the classification of a probability case and how to solve the task, you can follow a systematic approach. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide that may help:

1. **Identify the Type of Event:**
   - Is the event something that can be observed and measured objectively, or is it based on personal judgment or speculation?

2. **Objective vs. Subjective:**
   - If it’s an event with outcomes that can be observed and measured, it falls under objective probability.
   - If the probability is based on personal belief or information without empirical evidence, it’s a case of subjective probability.

3. **Objective Probability Branches:**
   - **Classical Probability**: Used when you can list all possible equally likely outcomes of an event. For example, the probability of rolling a die and getting a 4.
   - **Empirical Probability**: Used when calculating the probability based on the frequency of past events. For example, if historical data shows that a baseball player hits a home run 30% of the time they bat, that’s an empirical probability.

4. **Understanding the Available Information:**
   - Analyze the information you have. Do you have historical data or past frequencies of the events? If so, you’re likely dealing with empirical probability.
   - If you're dealing with theoretical scenarios with known possible outcomes, classical probability might be more suitable.

5. **Decision Making for Solving the Task:**
   - **Empirical data available**: Use empirical probability.
   - **Theoretical model or equally likely outcomes**: Use classical probability.
   - **Lack of objective data, relying on intuition or expert opinion**: Consider subjective probability.

6. **Solving the Task:**
   - **For Empirical Probability**: Collect historical data, calculate the frequency of the event (number of times the event occurred divided by the total number of trials).
   - **For Classical Probability**: Identify all possible outcomes, determine the number of favorable outcomes, and use the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes to calculate probability.
   - **For Subjective Probability**: This is more intuitive and less formulaic; you might rely on expert opinions or your own judgment after considering all available information.

Remember, the key to deciding on a method is to look at what information you have and what you're trying to predict or understand. If it's something that can be counted or has happened before, empirical methods are useful. If it's a theoretical scenario, classical probability may be appropriate.
